### Section 1. Introduction

Our topic is based on an AirBnb dataset in New York City for 2019. Ultimately, we hope to determine the best AirBnbâ€™s to rent based on variables such as price, size, reviews and availability. We wanted to look at Airbnb data because we thought this could be interesting insight into the economic housing market in NYC. We plan to compare price by neighborhood and borough which could provide interesting insights into the cost of living in NYC. We found our data on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). The data was collected by _______ , and includes variables: listing ID, name of the listing, host ID, name of the host, location, neighbourhood, latitude and longitude coordinates, room type, price in dollars, minimum_nights, number of reviews, latest review, number of reviews per month, amount of listing per host and availability.
