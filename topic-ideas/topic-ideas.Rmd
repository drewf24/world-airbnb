## Topic Ideas

### Idea #1

Data related to Climate Change. Specifically, we might want to take a look at the contributing factors to our current climate crisis or look at how various indicators of climate have changed in the last 50 years. Alternatively, we might be able to use regression (whick we will soon learn) to predict the state of the climate considering trends continue as is.

### Idea #2

We wanted to look at Airbnb data because we thought this could be interesting insight into the economic housing market in NYC. We could compare price by neighborhood and borough which could provide interesting insights into the cost of living in NYC.
