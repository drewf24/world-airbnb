## Topic Ideas

### Idea #1

We wanted to look at Airbnb data because we thought this could be interesting insight into the economic housing market in NYC. We could compare price by neighborhood and borough which could provide interesting insights into the cost of living in NYC.

### Idea #2 

We are interested in Uber and Lyft data because we want to are curious how certain factors such as time, location, and distance, will play a role in the price of Uber/Lyft rides. We are also interested in eventually using regression and statistics to predict the prices of Uber rides based on location, time, and distance.

### Idea #3

It could be interesting to explore what factors contribute to a "popular" (or not "popular") YouTube video, depending on country. Whether it be numerical variables like number of likes and comments or discrete ones like the YouTuber's name or whether or not they disabled comments.
